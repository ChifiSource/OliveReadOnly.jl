`OliveReadOnly` provides `Olive` with read only session cells, file cells, directories, projects, and exports. This is *primarily* intended for use with further extensions or customized `Olive` servers. This extension doesn't serve much purpose to a regular user unless they are sharing files, some of which they want to be read only, over a network with `Olive`.
